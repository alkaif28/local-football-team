## Voronoi map of footbal clubs throughout the world

This project has extensively used code from [Chris Zetter's Voronoi map](https://github.com/zetter/voronoi-maps). It uses D3 and Leaflet to generate a Voronoi map of the location of football (soccer) club stadiums throughout the world in the 2015/16 season. You can find the working version [here](https://guushoekman.com/local-football-team/).

### Explanation

A thorough explanation of the code has been providede already by Chris Zetter and can be found [here](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/15/building-a-voronoi-map-with-d3-and-leaflet/). In order to create your own Voronoi map with different data, the main component that needs to be changed is the .csv file; you will need the a name, the latitude and longitude, assign a type (which will appear in the menu), a colour, and optionally add a url.

### License

This code is released under the terms of the MIT license. The locations of the stadiums have been taken from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and [soccerway](http://soccerway.com).
